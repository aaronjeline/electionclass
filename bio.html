                            <h2>John Fitzgerald Kennedy<br>(1917-1963)</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
							<img src="img/bios/jfk.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also known as John F. Kennedy or simply JFK, was the 35th President of the United States. Born in Massachusetts, Kennedy was the son of multimillionaire Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Kennedy (n&eacute;e Fitzgerald). Joseph P. Kennedy amassed his fortune through his involvement in banking, shipbuilding, bootlegging, investing in the film industry, and skillfully navigating the stock market. Due to his father&rsquo;s monumental success (and later his own,) President Kennedy enjoyed lifelong financial security, developed a competitive yet socially refined, charismatic nature, and was introduced to American politics at a young age.<br />
Other important players in President Kennedy&rsquo;s early life were his eight siblings, his professors at Harvard University, and his comrades in the U.S. Navy from 1941-1945. Kennedy was raised surrounded by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, as well as the ideology of the Democratic Party. His convictions, including the necessity of advocacy for better working conditions, an end to racism, an increase in public housing, and a build-up in Social Security, were strong. Though Joseph Kennedy had always imagined that his elder son, Joe, would be the first of his children to run for office, the family&rsquo;s political standard was passed to President Kennedy after Joe was killed in World War II. Joe&rsquo;s tragic death at the age of 29 left a profound impact on the future president.<br />
After three terms in the House of Representatives (1947-1953,) Kennedy ran an unexpectedly successful Senate campaign, defeating the popular Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. This campaign was helped (and his life was forever changed) upon his marriage to the socially prominent, gorgeous, and influential Jacqueline Bouvier in September of 1953. Kennedy&rsquo;s political rise can also be attributed to his &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; of Illinois Governor and two-time presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson&rsquo;s mass support. <br />
Upon his declaration of his candidacy for the presidency, President Kennedy leaned on two of his brothers, Robert (&ldquo;Bob&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo;) and Edward (&ldquo;Teddy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ted,&rdquo;) for support more than ever before. Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon B. Johnson were his main opponents in the Democratic primaries; Kennedy eventually persuaded Johnson to become his running mate. He also battled Catholic stigma, and managed to overcome it by emphasizing his adamant belief in the separation of church and state.<br />
Kennedy faced a tougher battle in the general election, only narrowly defeating President Eisenhower&rsquo;s incumbent Vice President, Richard M. Nixon. Some believe that voter fraud is to blame for Nixon&rsquo;s loss, while others attribute it to Kennedy&rsquo;s undeniable victories in the four pivotal, televised presidential debates. Kennedy had a poise in front of the TV camera that few could match. In addition, Nixon felt an obligation to defend President Eisenhower&rsquo;s administration (as he was an essential part of it,) while Kennedy ran as the ever-effective &ldquo;change candidate.&rdquo;<br />
President Kennedy was the first (and remains the only) Roman Catholic president, and the youngest man to be elected to the nation&rsquo;s highest office. He enjoyed immense popularity among the American people. According to historian William Manchester, the charm and perceived perfection of his young family, as well as his overall optimism, &ldquo;sparked the idealism of a generation.&rdquo; He and the First Lady suffered personal tragedies, such as the early deaths of two of their children. President Kennedy also never recovered from the loss of two of his sisters, Rosemary and Kathleen--Rosemary was left permanently incapacitated by a failed lobotomy in 1941, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. The president had an unknown number of extramarital relationships while in office, but as far as the American public was concerned, the lives of the First Couple were idyllic and enviable. <br />
Foreign affairs were some of Kennedy&rsquo;s top priorities as president. His endeavors were not always successful, most notably in Cuba with the failed Bay of Pigs mission. His involvement in the Cold War, including many high-profile face-offs with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, culminated in the signing of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty--a major triumph for Kennedy&rsquo;s administration. President Kennedy was adamantly committed to halting the spread of communism, and he escalated America&rsquo;s involvement in Vietnam. He swore that the United States would put the first astronaut on the moon by 1971, though he unfortunately did not live to see this dream realized.<br />
In the days leading up to his assassination in 1963, Kennedy reportedly felt very confident in his ability to win reelection. However, he was concerned about a feud within the Democratic party of Texas that threatened to undermine the strength of his administration. As a display of unity, he decided to tour the state with a few of the adversaries and the First Lady, but was shot to death during the group&rsquo;s visit to Dallas. Lee Harvey Oswald, the 24-year-old assassin, was murdered himself a few days later. The First Lady, who was sitting beside her husband in an open limousine when he was suddenly struck by the two deadly bullets, was devastated and deeply traumatized.<br />
The American people had enjoyed incredible faith in the political establishment throughout Kennedy&rsquo;s political life, and especially under his administration. Commentators such as Gore Vidal and Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Jr. believe that his assassination marked a kind of turning point; the public turned fearful and suspicious of the goings-on in Washington, D.C. as they never had before. <br />

                            <h2>Richard Nixon<br>(1913)-(1994)</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/bios/nixon.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="width:250;height:228px;">
							Richard Nixon was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974. Prior to ascending to the presidency, Nixon also served as Vice President of the United States under Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961. <br />
Born in Yorba Linda, California, President Nixon was the son of Frank Nixon and Hannah Milhous. His father worked as a service station owner, grocer, and lemon farmer; the family often struggled financially. President Nixon was raised a Quaker. His early life was marked by two major tragedies--the loss of two of his four brothers. One of them, Harold Nixon, developed the tuberculosis that would eventually kill him when President Nixon was only a teenager. Due to this, President Nixon gave up a scholarship to Harvard University and instead attended Whittier College, choosing to remain in his California hometown to help support his family through a difficult time. <br />
After he obtained his undergraduate degree at Whittier, Nixon received a full scholarship to Duke University School of Law. He was an accomplished student, and eventually returned to California to join a firm. He also enjoyed theater, and met his wife, Patricia Ryan, while participating in a production of The Dark Tower. They married in 1940, and later welcomed two daughters, Tricia and Julie. <br />
During World War II, Nixon served in the U.S. Navy Reserve, eventually becoming a lieutenant commander in the Pacific. As a Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft, but reportedly sought the commission instead. After he returned to civilian life in 1945, a group of Whittier Republicans approached Nixon and encouraged him to run for Congress. Nixon was thrilled at the prospect, and after running a successful campaign, he became the representative for California&rsquo;s 12th congressional district. He won a seat in the Senate in 1950, and developed a reputation for an impressive grasp of foreign policy. As the youngest member of the Herter Committee, he worked to gain congressional approval of the Marshall Plan. After less than a decade of political life, he was selected to be Dwight D. Eisenhower&rsquo;s running mate in the 1952 presidential election. <br />
When President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in 1955, Nixon acted in his stead until he recovered. The vice president&rsquo;s performance during this tense period convinced most of his fellow Republicans that he had the capacity to serve in the nation&rsquo;s highest office. After President Eisenhower handily won reelection in 1956, Nixon embarked on many foreign trips on behalf of the administration, travelling throughout South America and even to the Soviet Union. <br />
When the 1960 election arrived, President Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican primaries. He selected the former Massachusetts senator, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as his running mate. Lodge&rsquo;s seat in the Senate had actually been taken from him by the Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy, in 1953; unfortunately for the Republican pair, Kennedy would again prove victorious, though the race was incredibly close and some would allege voter fraud. Nixon had struggled in the televised debates. Knowing this, he refused to contest the election, instead beginning to calculate his next political move. <br />
Nixon did not run for president again until 1968, having sensed discord in the Democratic Party under the Johnson administration. This second presidential campaign and the calculations of Nixon&rsquo;s marketing team are outlined in The Selling of the President 1968 by Joe McGinniss. Seizing the opportunity to present himself as measured and stable in a year of violent unrest in America, Nixon appeared frequently on television, and emphasized his political experience, his policy of toughness on crime, and his belief in &ldquo;peace with honor&rdquo; in Vietnam. His successful slogan was &ldquo;Nixon&rsquo;s the One!&rdquo; He went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey, as well as the American Independent candidate George Wallace, receiving a total of 301 electoral votes. <br />
As president, Nixon ended the draft, implemented multiracial committees across the South to completely eliminate segregation in schools, created a Presidential Task Force on Women&rsquo;s Rights, developed new laws intended to prevent crime, helped produce a treaty to limit nuclear weapons, and established the Department of Natural Resources and the Environmental Protection Agency. His controversial plan to withdraw American troops from Vietnam dominated much of his first term. He appointed conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, and continued America&rsquo;s long-standing tradition of opposing leftist revolutions in Latin America in favor of propping up dictatorships. President Nixon won reelection in 1972 in a landslide, accumulating 520 electoral votes. <br />
Many illegal activities on the part of members of the Nixon administration have come to be encompassed by the term &ldquo;Watergate.&rdquo; These activities included bugging the offices of political opponents, secretly recording conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office, and breaking into and burglarizing the Democratic Party headquarters in June 1972. Though Nixon denied wrongdoing, the House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the president in 1974. Nixon eventually admitted to misleading the country about when he learned of the 1972 burglaries. In light of his loss of political support, President Nixon resigned his office on August 9th, 1974. He was pardoned by his successor and former vice president, Gerald Ford, one month later. <br />
President Nixon became an author in his later years, publishing numerous books about his life and thoughts on foreign policy. He died from a stroke at the age of 81, mere months after his beloved wife of 53 years also passed away. <br />

                            <h2>Lyndon  Baines Johnson<br>(1908-1973)</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
							<img source="img/bios/lbj.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            Lyndon B. Johnson, also known as Lyndon Baines Johnson or simply LBJ, was the 36th President of the United States, in office from the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy to 1969. During the Kennedy administration, Johnson served as the Vice President of the United States. <br />
President Johnson was born in central Texas; though his father worked in the state legislature, his family still struggled to make ends meet throughout the majority of his childhood. While President Johnson&rsquo;s career initially centered on teaching schoolchildren in struggling Southern neighborhoods, he also forged strong connections with the Mexican American community in the process. These enduring ties to American Latinos were crucial to his political rise, and seeing the plight of the poor and racially marginalized convinced President Johnson to run for Congress. <br />
In 1934, President Johnson married his wife, Claudia &ldquo;Lady Bird&rdquo; Taylor. Lady Bird Johnson provided stability and unwavering support as the future president tried to break into politics. Running as a &ldquo;New Deal Democrat&rdquo; and believing strongly in the power of social programs to lift Americans out of poverty, President Johnson won his seat in the House of Representatives in 1937. Aside from an interruption to serve in WWII (where he received a Silver Star,) Johnson represented his district in the House for the next 12 years. After he finally won a Senate seat in 1948, he quickly rose to prominence, becoming the Democratic whip and eventually Minority Leader. When the Democratic Party later took back Congress, Johnson served as their Majority Leader. <br />
After developing a reputation for being an ambitious and ruthless senator, President Johnson decided to run for president in 1960. At the Democratic convention, he lost the nomination to John F. Kennedy on the first ballot; while many thought Johnson would not recover from this blow, he surprised them all by agreeing to serve as Kennedy&rsquo;s running mate. Once elected to the vice presidency, Johnson grew frustrated with his limited duties, and insecure about his role in the Kennedy administration. President Johnson felt that the elite, high-society Kennedys turned up their noses at him due to his &ldquo;unsophisticated&rdquo; Southern drawl and less-than-prosperous background. In short, he felt ignored and undervalued--that his years of congressional experience were going to waste. <br />
On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated while touring Johnson&rsquo;s home state of Texas. Johnson took the oath of office while flying on Air Force One at 2:38pm that day, immediately beginning work to calm the national hysteria that ensued. He insisted that the best way to honor President Kennedy&rsquo;s memory was to pass civil rights legislation. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 only five months later, a law that prohibited racial segregation, guaranteed voting rights, prevented discrimination on the basis of sex or race in the workforce/places of public accommodation, and authorized the Justice Department to sue school boards practicing discrimination. This was a crucial step in the fight to integrate American schools. <br />
Promoting his vision of &ldquo;the Great Society,&rdquo; President Johnson had tremendous dreams of establishing social programs to bring &ldquo;an end to poverty and injustice.&rdquo; In the 1964 elections, Johnson defeated his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, with ease. He had painted Goldwater as an extremist that could cause nuclear war, while portraying himself as rational and experienced. In the end, President Johnson won 61% of the overall vote. <br />
Despite his grand aspirations, most of President Johnson&rsquo;s efforts to develop economically depressed areas were overshadowed by his escalation of crisis in Vietnam. When the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution granted Johnson the constitutional authority to lead a war effort in Vietnam without congressional approval, he began to expand American military involvement. By the end of 1965, the number of American soldiers stationed in Vietnam had reached 180,000. By 1968, the number peaked at 550,000. Public opposition to the war also grew, with protesters chanting &ldquo;Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?&rdquo; <br />
When Senator Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy both declared their intentions to challenge the sitting president in the Democratic primaries of 1968, President Johnson shocked all by renouncing his constitutional right to seek reelection. His vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became another candidate for the Democratic nomination. After President Nixon&rsquo;s victory in the general election, President Johnson left office in January 1969, and retired to his Texas farm. Johnson suffered a heart attack and died in 1973. <br />

							Barry Goldwater was a United States senator from Arizona, who also served as the Republican nominee for president in the presidential election of 1964. Senator Goldwater strongly believed in a harsh diplomatic stance towards the Soviet Union, and ending communism worldwide. His fervent conservatism helped him win the hard-fought Republican primaries of 1964, but he soon faced challenges in the general election; incumbent President Johnson was enjoying widespread public approval at the time, and was painting Goldwater as a dangerous figure who would begin an era of nuclear war. The infamous &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo; ad, produced by the Johnson campaign, took advantage of Goldwater&rsquo;s past statements that, as president, he might utilize nuclear bombs in Vietnam. Goldwater&rsquo;s campaign also suffered as a result of his vote against the popular Civil Rights Act of 1964. Goldwater&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;In your heart, you know he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; was often countered with &ldquo;In your guts, you know he&rsquo;s nuts!&rdquo; <br />
Senator Goldwater selected Representative William E. Miller of New York as his running mate, and attempted to convince the American public that the pair would restore order and be tough on crime in an age of lawlessness. His campaign was ill-fated, however, and he won a mere 6 states on election day. Afterwards, he returned to the Senate, and led the delegation of Republican politicians who pushed President Nixon to resign from office in 1974. Despite Johnson&rsquo;s landslide victory in 1964, Goldwater remained a prominent, yet controversial figure in American politics for decades; in the 1980s, though he did retire from the Senate, he continued to vehemently defend what he described as personal privacy and individual liberties. On May 12th, 1986, Goldwater was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. <br />
(An amusing aside: One of Goldwater&rsquo;s more famous moments occurred in 1981, when he responded to Jerry Falwell&rsquo;s opposition to the nomination of Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor to the Supreme Court. Falwell had stated that &ldquo;Every good Christian ought to be concerned&rdquo; about O&rsquo;Connor, causing Goldwater to retort: \&quot;Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass!\&quot; Goldwater led the effort for O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s Senate confirmation; she was the first woman to be appointed to the Court.) <br />

                            <h2>Hubert Humphrey<br>(1911-1978)</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/bios/hh.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="height:361px;width:462px">
                            Hubert Humphrey was the 38th Vice President of the United States, serving from 1965 to 1969. Humphrey was also the Democratic nominee in the presidential election of 1968, after President Johnson declined to run for reelection. <br />
	After growing up in South Dakota, Humphrey attended the University of Minnesota, and received his pharmacist license in 1931. He ran his father&rsquo;s pharmacy for 6 years, before deciding to become a political science professor. Eventually turning his attention to pursuing a career as an elected official, he became mayor of Minneapolis in 1945. His work as mayor helped bolster his Senate campaign; he ultimately won a seat in 1948, and served as a senator for the next 16 years. He ran two failed presidential campaigns in the 1952 and 1960 Democratic primaries, but became assistant Senate majority leader in 1961. Humphrey&rsquo;s battle against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Democratic primaries is outlined in Theodore White&rsquo;s The Making of the President, 1960. <br />
After President Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination in 1963, Lyndon B. Johnson ascended to the presidency. Johnson chose Humphrey to be his running mate in the 1964 elections; the pair won in a landslide. From then on, Humphrey was extremely loyal to President Johnson, even when Johnson expanded American military involvement in Vietnam. While Humphrey had been skeptical of this plan, and much of his fellow liberals opposed it, he went on to publicly defend American participation in the Vietnam War. Though this decision gained him favor in the Johnson administration, Humphrey made many enemies as a result; when Johnson announced that he would not seek reelection in 1968, Humphrey was not accepted by all as the rightful &ldquo;heir&rdquo; to the Democratic party&rsquo;s nomination, and opponents such as Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy also announced their candidacies. <br />
These three men battled for the nomination until, on June 5th, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was shockingly assassinated. George McGovern, a South Dakota senator and friend of the Kennedy family, decided to run in RFK&rsquo;s place. Only a few months later at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Humphrey officially gained the nomination, but the event was plagued by rampant protests and rioting; the candidates&rsquo; opposing positions on the Vietnam War were tearing the party apart, and Humphrey&rsquo;s refusal to criticize President Johnson ultimately cost him the general election. He lost to former Vice President Richard Nixon on November 5th, 1968. Though he sought the Democratic nomination again in 1972, he did not gain it, instead losing to George McGovern. <br />
In his later years, Humphrey enjoyed a friendly relationship with President Jimmy Carter. When Humphrey announced that he was suffering from terminal bladder cancer in 1977, President Carter honored him by giving him command of Air Force One on October 23rd. Humphrey ultimately succumbed to the cancer in 1978; his beloved wife, Muriel, served in the Senate in his place until a special election was held. <br />

							Eugene McCarthy was a United States senator, known for his vehement opposition to the Vietnam War. Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s unanticipated, impressive performance in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries led President Lyndon B. Johnson to give up his bid for reelection. <br />
McCarthy enjoyed support from younger voters, who shared his belief that President Johnson ought to withdraw all American soldiers from Vietnam, and captured 42% of the vote in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. This startled President Johnson, who had expected to win in a landslide, causing him to announce that he was withdrawing from the race. Robert F. Kennedy, sensing an opportunity, challenged McCarthy and Johnson&rsquo;s vice president, Hubert Humphrey. These three battled for the Democratic nomination, but the race changed drastically when RFK was shockingly assassinated in June 1968. <br />
Despite the fact that he had technically won more votes than any other Democratic candidate, McCarthy did not gain the nomination. At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he lost to Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Protests raged throughout the city, and though McCarthy ran for the nomination again in 1972, he was unsuccessful. <br />
McCarthy died at the age of 89 in 2005. <br />
